# To-Do Application

## Overview

This To-Do application is a robust task management tool designed for efficiency and ease of use. Built with React, Tailwind CSS, and DaisyUI, it provides a responsive and user-friendly interface. The application leverages private routing to ensure that only authenticated users can access their to-do lists. Tasks can be easily dragged and dropped to reorder them. Data persistence is managed through local storage using the `localforage` library for enhanced performance and reliability.

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the build tool for fast development and build processes.

- **Filter To-do List:** Enables users to filter the to-do list to view only completed or incomplete items.
- **Persist Data:** Uses `localforage` library for persisting to-do list data in local storage between sessions.

- **Error Handling:** Includes mechanisms to gracefully handle invalid inputs or unexpected errors.
- **User Authentication:** Provides authentication functionality to allow multiple users to manage their own to-do lists.
- **Private Routing:** Ensures that only authenticated users can access their to-do lists.
